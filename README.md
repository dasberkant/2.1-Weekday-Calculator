# 2.1-Weekday-Calculator

In this question you have two tasks:
i. Determining the weekday of a given date: It is given that March 7th, 2022 is Monday. Write a script to find the weekday when a specific date is given. The date information is provided by the user as an input. Day, month, and year information will be entered separately.
First the user will provide the day as an integer between 1 and 30. Then, the month should be provided again as an integer, i.e. 1 for January, 2 for February, etc. and as a final input Year will be entered by the user i.e. 1024, 1998 etc. Here we assume that each month has 30 days and each year has 360 days. Your script will determine the weekday and return its name as an output.
ii. Finding the difference between two dates: You are also expected to calculate the difference between March 7th, 2022 and the date that user provided in terms of day, month, and year.
You are required to use only the conditionals for this problem.
